    title: "God",
    statement:
      "We believe in one God, creator of all things, seen and unseen. All things have been created by Him and for Him. Eternally existing in unity and purpose of three equally divine persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Having limitless knowledge and sovereign in all things, including salvation, for His good pleasure, according to his will and for His purposes alone. God has graciously purposed from eternity to redeem a people for Himself, the Bride of Christ, and to make all things new for His own glory.",

    title: "The Bible",
    statement:
      "We believe that God has spoken in the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, through the words of the divinely appointed human authors. God's word is without error and reveals the complete revelation of His will for salvation and the ultimate authority by which every realm of human knowledge and endeavor should be judged. Therefore, it is to be believed in all that it teaches, obeyed in all that it requires, and trusted in all that it promises.",

    title: "The Human Condition",
    statement:
      "We believe that God created males and females in His image but they sinned when tempted by Satan. In union with Adam, human beings are sinners by nature and by choice, alienated from God, dead in their trespasses and sin, children of wrath and under the wrath of God. Only through God's saving work in Jesus Christ can a person be rescued, reconciled, and renewed.",

He lived a sinless life, was crucified under Pontius Pilate, arose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father as our High Priest and Advocate.",

    title: "The Work of Christ",
    statement:
      "We believe that Jesus Christ, as our representative and substitute, shed His blood on the cross as the perfect, all-sufficient sacrifice for sin.

    title: "The Means of Salvation",
    statement:
      "We believe that salvation is the work of God. That salvation is by God's grace alone through faith alone and that these are gifts of God. Salvation is the result of God's unrestricted power, according to the purpose of His will, and to Him alone, belongs all the praise, honor, and glory.",

  {
    title: "The Holy Spirit",
    statement:
      "We believe that the Holy Spirit, in all that He does, glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ. He convicts the world regarding sin. He regenerates sinners, those who are otherwise dead in their sin by making them be born again and alive in Christ. In Him believers are baptized into union with Christ and adopted as heirs in the family of God. He also indwells, illuminates, guides, equips, and empowers His church for Christ-like living and service.",

  {
    title: "Christian Living",
    statement:
      "We believe that God's justifying grace must not be separated from His sanctifying power and purpose. God commands us to love Him supremely and others sacrificially and to live out our faith with care for one another, compassion toward the poor, and justice for the oppressed. With God's word, the Spirit's power, and fervent prayer in Christ's name, we are to combat the spiritual forces of evil.
