           Our Prayer Chain ministry is led by Pastor Mark Cook. We meet the
           first Friday of each month at 7 PM in the Sanctuary to pray for the
           needs of those that have been submitted to us throughout the month.
           To join us in our prayer meetings please reach out to Pastor Cook to
           become part of the ministry.
